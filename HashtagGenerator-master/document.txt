Virtual Reality  Lets Get Into The Matrix I dreamof how the world is a conspired one like we are in theMatrix.I often think of how cool it
would be to have those computer-like eyes of Robocop and Terminator.Terminator vs RobocopAnd I dream of travelling to places as well as
living in ananimeworld.All these fantasies I had been living in might be an imagination-powered reality. The vague imaginations were not
something I could really be living in but the idea ofinteractingwith such a realityis intriguing. The matrix is never a final destination
but a means to empower ones productivity, imagination, knowledge and wisdom. Imagination-Powered RealityThe advent of computers has changed
the world in a lot of ways that no one had imagined it to. And on the edge of this feat, evolves the notion of living and interacting with a
virtual world.Handshaking a virtual person :DThe definition ofvirtual realitycomes, naturally, from the definitions for both virtual and
reality. Virtual is near and reality is what we experience as human beings. So, virtual reality is basically near-reality. This
could, of course, mean anything but it usually refers to a specific type of reality emulation.VR HeadsetBasically, a person straps a
box/helmet-like device over her head so that she can look into the box to see the virtual environment inside.The device contains various
sensors likegyroscope,accelerometer, and in some cases external sensors to track the movement of the head as well as the person. The goal of
the hardware is to create what appears to be a life sized, 3D virtual environment without the boundaries we usually associate with TV or
computer screens. So whichever way you look, the screen mounted to your face follows you. Back To The RetrofuturismLets look at the past
that has powered todays future.1957  SensoramaThe first virtual reality machine was arguably the Sensorama, invented by Morton Heilig in
1957.credit: wikipediaThis bulky machine had a large screen inside along with all the sensors that could control pressure, temperature and
such, so that the person could really feel the virtual environment.Heres the video that sums up this ingenious invention.1965  The Sword
of DemoclesThe first head-mounted stereoscopic display for viewing and navigating a computer generated environment was the Sword of Democles
by Ivan Sutherland. Ivan Sutherland was already a respected person in the field of computer graphics.The virtual environment inside was just
a wire-framed world with stereoscopic display.This is perhaps the seed of todays virtual reality. But it was bulky and the headset was
immobile.1960s-1980sSteady development of early VR during 60s-70s were driven mainly byUS Militaryworks on vehicle simulators, special teams
atNASAand also the researchers inThe University of Utah.This progress along with enhancement in computer graphics technology really began to
gain momentum in the 1980s. And around 1985 something marvelous was created by the NASA team.1985 Virtual Environment WorkstationNASA
created this virtual workstation. This next step in VR consisted of 2LCDTV displays, wide-angled stereoscopic optics and a motorcycle
helmet.Motorcycle Helmet VR headset by NASAThe user could really have an immersive experience into the virtual world. This was perhaps VR at
its finest at the time. Heres the demo of the technology:1990s  Virtual Reality Video GamesDuring 1990s, video games with VR flavors began
to emerge. The game industry really changed the use case for VR. The earlier publicly available VR games were available in the form of
arcade machines.VFX1 HeadGearVX1 HeadgearTheForte VFX1was a consumer-level VR headset. But it was quickly outrun by other popular companies
like Nintendo and Sega.1995  The Virtual BoyThis 32-bit table top video game console developed by Nintendo was marketed as a portable video
game console capable of displaying true 3D graphics.Well, if you like red and black graphics being true enough... :DVirtual Boy by
NintendoDespite its marketing strategies, it was a commercial flop for three reasons.The price was freakishly unrealisticUsers were reported
to have nausea and headaches.Users felt uncomfortable for the positions to play the games.(That nausea and headache is still persistent
today; at least in some VR sets.)1990s  In a nutshellEven after numerous attempts and a series of only (minor) successes, Virtual reality,
in reality, had failed to deliver its promises.A decade-long breathThe 2000s saw the rise of Facebook, Android, iPhones and tons of
hypocrites; fall of Twin Towers, monarchy in Nepal; death of Michael Jackson, Osama Bin Laden.And the 200s also re-established VR as a thing
of retrofuturism.So, what now?2012  Oculus KickstarterOut of the long forgotten realm of VR, Oculus came into headlines for its
kickstarter: Oculus Rift. It took the world by surprise for its promises of VR.2014 + more Facebook and OculusIn 2014, Facebook purchased
Oculus for $2 billion. The vision of Facebook to incorporate virtual reality as a means for bringing the world even more closer than the
traditional social media became an ambitious project.What Facebook Looks Like in Virtual Reality With OculusThis can really be a game
changer.Demonstration of how you could use Facebook in VRSamsung Gear VR, HTC Vibes and tons of other expensive thingsJust when Oculus
Rifts capability was envisioned, other companies stepped into the VR race. Samsung with its promising Samsung Gear VR and HTC Vibe (along
with other companies) giving chills to the users have reanimated the VR from its technological grave.The use of smartphones as rendering
device for such headsets is intriguing in itself.Just place your smartphone (that which has a minimum hardware spec) in the headset and you
are good to go.The fact is  these VR headsets are a bit out of reach for broke people like us.Google Cardboard for everyoneAnd then, Google
released thisDIYGoogle Cardboardas a way to say Screw you to all those expensive sets.Google Cardboard be like...The cardboard is simple
and just works in letting people experience virtual reality using their smartphones. Google has released the blueprints on actually
crafting these cardboard sets in your own home.Google Cardboard360 Degree VideosVirtual Reality doesnt stand a chance without its software
parts. And 360 degree video has made it possible for users to watch a video with VR headset with whole 360 degree angle of
freedom.Augmented/Mixed RealityDont scratch your head on this term. Unlike virtual reality, augmented and mixed reality is where yourender
virtual objects onto the real world.You can, for instance, project a virtual (fake) plane in the backyard of your house using such
technology.Interaction with holographic projections can really be a game changer. Despite VR being the technology of the near future,
augmented reality might change the world in terms of entertainment, education, work-spaces, gaming, etc. Companies like Google and Microsoft
have already manifested such technology like:Microsofts HololensThe headset is intriguing for its real demo and use-cases. A use-case for
Hololens, as Microsoft has showcased, is having LIVE video chat with AR.A person interacting with virtual objects using HololensNow,
developers can create AR apps for Hololens to make it even cooler.Google GlassesUnlike Hololens, Google Glass is actually designed in the
shape of a pair of eyeglasses. It has a touch sensor for voice-activated google now.Google GlassBut, google glass could never really render
itself as a real product for consumers because it failed to help consumers understand why they needed such a device. But, hey, its promises
were ambitious despite lackingobject recognition, good video recording options and above all it was launched when it was in a prototype
stage unlike Oculus Rift and Hololens which took time to achieve near-perfection.And then Magic Leap HappenedMagic Leap might be the worlds
most secretive startup for virtual reality. It has already been backed up by Google, Microsoft and such. And it might be the future of
computing in a nutshell.Check out the aweso
